Notes:
    - creating a constant in the program ensures that the variable will never change.

        circumference = 3.14159 * diamter;

    - The reason you would want to use a variable name instead ofr number is for meaning.
        - the name means more than the numbers.

        owed = 0.015 * housevalue; vs. owed = taxrate * housevalue;

    - if you used a constant in several places, you only need to change it in one place instead of everywhere you used the number.
    - assign a constant:

        #define constant_name constant_value

        - compile time substitution of the value;

        #define statements can be added anywhere in the program, but should be used in the beginning.

        const in MONTHS = 12; // this is another way to declare a constant.

        enums are also a type of constants.
