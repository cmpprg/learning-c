NOTES:
    - Function is a self-containde unit of program code designed to accomplish a particular task.

    - Functions are sometimes called subroutines or procedures.

    - Som cause an action to take place(printf, scanf) - command

    - Some just find a value.(strlen()) - query

    - Allow for the divide and conquer strategy.
        - tasks can be divided into several independent subtasks
        - reduce the overall complexity
        - separate functions are written for each subtasks
        - we can further divide each subtsk inyo dmsllrt dunysdkd, gutyhrt reducing complexity.

    - Make it easier to find and fix bugs in code.

    - reduce duplication of code
        -save you time when writing, testing and debugging code.
        - reduce size of source code

    - Advantages
        - Helps with readability, program is better organized and easier to read and easier to change or fix.
        - Reduce overall dev time.
        - Cant be tested independently.
        - functions can be used in many programs
        - black box:
            - input in,
            - output out.
